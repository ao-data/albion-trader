# About
This is a tool that acts as a memorizer of the trades you've read in your inbox, so that if you get 50+ notifications, quickly click through them, and delete them, you can still access the data later.
Additionally, you can get a table format export under http://localhost:22009/table.
Therefore, if you do a large number of trades, especially 'flips' - buys and resells in the same market, you can see trade stats, such as the actual price paid and earnings in a compact visual format for easier scanning.
